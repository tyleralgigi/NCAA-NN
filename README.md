# NCAA Neural Network

no longer being updated
working as of June 2020

## version 1.0.0

  Welcome to my first AI project in python. This project is used to predict National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) mens basketball scores. My reasoning for developing this project was to be able to compare my predictions to more known big name company predictions like ESPN, OddSharks,CBSSports, etc. This project is complete and I will most likely not be returning to it.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See Installing and Run AI to get this project running on your machine.

### Installing

First clone repository by using git clone or downloading the zip:
```
git clone https://github.com/tyleralgigi/ALBURT_AI.git
```

*Please make sure you have python 3 or greater installed before continuing.*

After downloading use pip to install required libraries: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
Then once all required libraries are installed, run main.py to collect up to date data: 
```
python main.py
```

### Run AI

The neural network will be run 16 times and give a average final score prediction in gamePicks.csv
```
python ml.py
```
