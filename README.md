# NCAA Neural Network

working as of June 2020

## version 1.0.0

  Welcome to my NCAA Neruel Network developed in python. This project is used to predict National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) mens basketball scores. My motivation was to be able to compare my predictions to more known big name company predictions like ESPN, OddSharks,CBSSports, etc.
  
  To begin I gather my data from [sports-reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/) where I collected present and historal data. Then I processed the data by structuring, cleaning and transforming it to a usable form which was then feed into my Nerual network to be trained.
